When you create a new HTML file in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and use the `!` snippet, it generates an entire HTML boilerplate because it's a common starting point for HTML development. This boilerplate provides a basic structure for an HTML document, including the necessary `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, as well as a UTF-8 character encoding declaration.

The purpose of this boilerplate is to save time and provide a starting point for your HTML development. Instead of manually typing out the basic structure of an HTML document every time you create a new file, you can use the `!` snippet to quickly generate it.

Here's what the generated HTML boilerplate typically looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

This boilerplate includes:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.
- The `<html>` tag, which represents the root element of the HTML document and contains all other HTML elements.
- The `<head>` section, which contains metadata about the document, such as the character encoding (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`), viewport settings, and the document title.
- The `<body>` section, which contains the visible content of the HTML document.

By generating this boilerplate automatically, VS Code helps streamline the initial setup process for new HTML files and encourages best practices in HTML document structure. It's a convenient feature that saves developers time and ensures consistency in their HTML projects.
