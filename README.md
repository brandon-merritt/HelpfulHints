### Overview

If you want your folders to drop down when you create them instead of inline, especially for new folders with nothing in them. It's at least easier for me, so it might be for you, too.

### Instructions

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**: Launch the VSCode application on your computer.

2. **Access Settings**: There are two ways to access the settings:
    - Press `Ctrl + ,` (Cmd + , on macOS) to open the settings directly.
    - Click on `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings`.

3. **Search for Compact Folders Setting**: In the settings search bar at the top, type "explorer.compactFolders".

4. **Adjust the Setting**:
    - You will see an option named "Explorer: Compact Folders".
    - Toggle the setting to your preferred option:
        - `On`: Folders are displayed in a compact form with a single row.
        - `Off`: Folders are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure.

5. **View Changes**: The Explorer in VSCode will reflect the changes immediately.
