## Changing Folder Display Mode in Visual Studio Code

This guide will walk you through changing the folder display mode in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to suit your preferences.

### Overview

By default, VSCode displays folders in a hierarchical tree structure in the Explorer. However, you have the option to switch to a more compact view where folders are displayed in a single row.

### Instructions

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**: Launch the VSCode application on your computer.

2. **Access Settings**: There are two ways to access the settings:
    - Press `Ctrl + ,` (Cmd + , on macOS) to open the settings directly.
    - Click on `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings`.

3. **Search for Compact Folders Setting**: In the settings search bar at the top, type "explorer.compactFolders".

4. **Adjust the Setting**:
    - You will see an option named "Explorer: Compact Folders".
    - Toggle the setting to your preferred option:
        - `On`: Folders are displayed in a compact form with a single row.
        - `Off`: Folders are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure.

5. **View Changes**: The Explorer in VSCode will reflect the changes immediately.
